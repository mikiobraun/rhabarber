	* except.[ch]: resurrected except.[ch] - we might not need it for
	rhabarber, but maybe for some future project.

2005-11-27  harmeli  <harmeli@xyan>

	* Makefile: try and catch macros are now in eval.h.  also got rid
	of except.[ch] which are no longer needed.

2005-11-24  Mikio Braun  <mikio@bone20.first.fraunhofer.de>

	* cstream.c (sstropen): Fixed bug that returned garbage if nothing
	gets every written to a string-stream.
	(ssputc): Fixed a bug that you couldn't add more than BUFSIZE
	characters. (Reallocation of buffer was done correctly, but the
	buffer length was not updated)

	* except.h: Added note about 'return' inside 'try' or 'catch'
	block, which is not allowed.  Otherwise, 'except_tos' does not
	have a proper value anymore.

2005-06-27  Mikio Braun  <mikio@bone20.first.fraunhofer.de> + stefan

	* except.h, except.c: exceptions are now void pointers.

2005-06-24  Stefan Harmeling  <harmeli@bone11.first.fraunhofer.de>

	* except.h, expect.c: There was a bug in the setjmp/longjmp
	business: 'except_tos' was increased with each new try block, but
	only decreased if we throw an exception.  Hereby, we reach quickly
	'EXCEPT_MAX_NESTING'.  Now, 'except_tos' is increased at the
	beginning of the macro 'try' and decreased at the end of macro
	'endtry'.  All other macros keep except_tos constant.  Also, I
	moved 'except_tos++' into the line before 'setjmp' to avoid
	confusion with the current state/stack.  I think this way it is
	more clear.  Furthermore, the initial value of 'except_tos' is now
	-1, so also the check at the beginning of 'throw' has been
	changed.  Inside a try block, 'except_tos' also is the index of
	the current entries in 'except_stack' and 'except_retval'.
