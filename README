rhabarber
A new progamming language

The goal is to design a general purpose programming language specially
tailored to the needs of machine learning.

The special requirements of machine learning include:

    * Support for interactive, explorative programming
    * Built-in support for data types like matrices, trees, et cetera
    * Scaling prototypical implementations to large data sets 

Rhabarber tries to be as flexible as possible, and providing powerful
features in seamless manner.

THE EASY STEPS FOR HARVESTING DELICOUS RHABABER:

0. go to http://code.google.com/p/rhabarber/downloads/list

1. download the binary 'rhabarber' for your OS

2. download the test code 'init.rha' and 'test.rha'

3. run './rhabarber < test.rha | grep false'

4. if all goes well, there shouldn't be any output

5. run './rhabarber' and you can play around with it after seeing something like:

   Delicious rhabarber!
