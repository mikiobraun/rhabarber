	* list.tmpl (get, next, ...): added test @done() before accessing
	the iterator to avoid segfault.

	* maketmpl.l (expand_prefix): creating 'treeintint' under cygwin
	(on my IBM laptop) lead to segfault.  the problem was in
	expand_prefix(): after mallocing new space for char *s, s was not
	empty, thus strcatting prefix to s increased the size of s and the
	beginning of s was some crappy characters.  initializing s with
	the empty string solved the problem.
