The goal is to design a general purpose programming language specially tailored to the needs of [machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

The special requirements of machine learning include:

  * Support for interactive, explorative programming
  * Built-in support for data types like matrices, trees, et cetera
  * Scaling prototypical implementations to large data sets

Rhabarber tries to be as flexible as possible, and providing powerful features in a seamless manner.

Note that currently there is no support available, though feedback is appreciated. `:)`
