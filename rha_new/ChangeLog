	* gtree.h: If FAST_GTREE_LIMIT is defined, the first
	FAST_GTREE_LIMIT - 1 symbols will be stored in a field, not the
	tree. While this reduces lookups to O(1), object creation becomes
	more expensive. For moderate values of FAST_GTREE_LIMIT, for
	example, 12, runtime for fib(25) decreases to 60%.

	* rha_config.pl: symbols are now generated in the order they were
	defined.
