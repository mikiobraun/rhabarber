	* core.c (for_fn), prelude.rha: for-loops for tuples work, example
	code:

	      t = tuple.new(3);
	      t.set(0, 5);
	      t.set(1, 3);
	      t.set(2, 17);
	      y = 0;
	      for (x in t) y += x;
	      y == 25

	* gtree.h: If FAST_GTREE_LIMIT is defined, the first
	FAST_GTREE_LIMIT - 1 symbols will be stored in a field, not the
	tree. While this reduces lookups to O(1), object creation becomes
	more expensive. For moderate values of FAST_GTREE_LIMIT, for
	example, 12, runtime for fib(25) decreases to 60%.

	* rha_config.pl: symbols are now generated in the order they were
	defined.
