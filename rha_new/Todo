  to used void as a default value in functions.

* f.fn_data.parent.parent.string() does fail

* right now after f(x) = 2*x; f(y) = 3*y; both implementations are
  kept, but the older one is not accessible anymore

* replace in all function "()" with "(void)"

* remove assert(pt==*) in wrap_*

* remove wrap_symbol from symbol_fn.h

* remove the vtuple_make stuff for ellipses, probably we need a big
