rhabarber
A new progamming language

The goal is to design a general purpose programming language specially
tailored to the needs of machine learning.

The special requirements of machine learning include:

    * Support for interactive, explorative programming
    * Built-in support for data types like matrices, trees, et cetera
    * Scaling prototypical implementations to large data sets 

Rhabarber tries to be as flexible as possible, and providing powerful
features in seamless manner.

===========================================

THE NOT SO EASY STEPS FOR COMPILING DELICOUS RHABABER:

0. get the source code from http://code.google.com/p/rhabarber/

1. You'll need a compiler which can handle C99, and the libgc library,
available at http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/

2. run 'configure'

3. run 'make all'

4. run 'cd rha'

4. run './rhabarber < test.rha | grep ^false'

5. if all goes well, there shouldn't be any output

6. if you want type 'make install'

6. run './rhabarber' and you can play around with it after seeing something like:

   Delicious rhabarber!
