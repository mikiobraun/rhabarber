	* Switched to autoconf + automake configuration. Now, libgc has to
	be installed somewhere. To do: write sensible tests for python and
	matlab, currently they are just set to false. "make all", "make
	dist" and building from the distribution works, but "make
	distcheck" fails due to some weird bug in rha/rha_stub.pl


	In case you don't know about autotools:

	Global configuration file is "configure.ac". Makefiles are
	replaced by "Makefile.am". Dependencies are defined by special
	variables, having the format programname_WHAT, for example (WHAT =)

	SOURCES (the actual sources from which the program is built)
	LDADD (objects to link into)
	CFLAGS (flags for compiling this program)

	Some of the "Makefile.am"s are pretty weird because we have make
	use of automatically generated source files quite heavily.

	If you change "configure.ac" or any "Makefile.am", it's best to do
	a "autoreconf && configure" in the base directory to remake
	everything.
	

	Things we get "for free" with autoconf:

	  "make all" - compiles everything
	  "make dist" - constructs a tar.gz file for distribution
	  "make install" - actually installs files somewhere
	  "make uninstall" - uninstalls files
