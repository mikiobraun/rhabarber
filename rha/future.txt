Some cool ideas for future work:

1. Profiler:  have a horizontal bar plot with a row for each function
   and with some reset button.  While running a program update the bar
   plot constantly.  Reset sets the bars back to zero.

2. quote function:

   `(x) returns the parsetree of "x"

3. define functions that don't evaluate:

   for(x, `y, `z) = { z.compile(); y.compile(); bla; blub; }

   the quote registers for as a function that is parsed differently,
   i.e. it creates a special macro.

   z.compile() creates bytes compiled code.  also z.eval()

4. make functions of .o files available if .h file is accessible
   use this feature for all c-implemented rhabarber functions.
