// I think there are some problems with the parenta and environments:

a = { @f(x) = 2*x }

// who is the parent a?  probably the current scope.

// what about
a.f.env

g(y) = 3*y

// what is
g.env

// STRANGE:
rha[1]$ g(x) = 2*x
[function with args (x) and code (op* 2 x)]
rha[2]$ g.env
[method 0x10058360 bound to 0x10055c80]
rha[3]$ g
[function with args (x) and code (op* 2 x)]
