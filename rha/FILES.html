<h2>Program initialization</h2>

<p>The general project flow is like this:</p>
<pre>
    main
      init
      init_stubs
      execute "-x" commands
      execute files passed on command line
      enter read_eval_loop
</pre>

<p>The read-eval-loops always have this structure:</p>
<pre>
    obtain parsed code using rhaparsestring or rhaparsefile
    call eval(root, code) in a try/catch block
</pre>

<p>The initialization is in two steps:
<ol>
<li>in <tt>init()</tt>, the different modules are actually
initialized.
<li>in <tt>init_stubs()</tt>, the corresponding stub initializers are
called. These mostly built the corresponding objects and add them to
the root environment.
</ol>
The functions also call the <tt>init()</tt> functions for other
classes on which they depend, so that it should in principle not
matter in which order the init functions are called.
</p>

<h2>Object model</h2>

<p>In rhabarber, an object consists of some opaque data and a number
of slots. The opaque data is an ecapsulated C structure. For example,
an integer contains the value in its data part. The slots assign
symbols to other rhabarber objects.</p>

<p>The slots of an object can be enriched by linking an object to
other objects. There exists two kinds of links, the <tt>parent</tt>
and the <tt>this</tt> link. The <tt>parent</tt> link is static and is set at
object construction time. The <tt>this</tt> pointer is more dynamic is
mainly used in methods calls. The lookup order is:
<tt>local-this-parent</tt>.
</p>

<p>In plots, the <tt>parent</tt> pointer is often drawn as pointing
up, while the <tt>this</tt>pointer points to the left.
</p>
<pre class=example>

               parent object
                  ^
                  | parent
          this    |
    this <-----  data:  some C struct
   object       slots:  sym1 -> obj1
                        sym2 -> obj2
                             ...
                        symn -> objn

</pre>

<p>The main reason for linking the slots is, of course, code
re-use. Since you can alter the semantic of the slots, cloning is not
equal to sub-typing.
</p>

<p>Technically, there is no difference between a method call and a
ordinary function call. The receiver of a method call is passed by
setting the <tt>this</tt> pointer of the function to the receiver when
calling the function. This is kinda whacky because it is not
guaranteed that the <tt>this</tt> pointer of the function points to
the receiver throughout the function call (it will get overwritten if
something else happens), but that information is not accessed anyway.
</p>

<h2>Construction of the activation record</h2>

<p>
There are basically two kinds of function calls, pure function calls
and method calls. The environment in which the function's code is
executed is called the <em>activation record</em>.
</p>

<p>In general, the activtaion record consists of the functions
syntactic scope plus the arguments. The syntactic scope is the
environment in which the function has been defined.</p>

<p>For method calls, there exist two alternatives: Either the slots of
the receiver of the call (the "this" object) are also part of the
activation record, or a special name is used to refer to the
receiver. An example for the first kind is <tt>C++</tt>, and for the
latter is <tt>python</tt>, which uses the first argument of the method
to refer to the receiver.</p>

<p>In rhabarber, the activation record is constructed by first cloning
the syntactic environment of the function. Then, the arguments values
are assigned in the activation record. Finally, for method calls, the
<tt>this</tt> pointer of the activation record is set to the
receiver.</p>

<p>The final picture looks like this:</p>
<pre class=example>

               syntactic environment of f
                  ^
                  | parent
		  |
                  
 method   this   +ACTIVATION RECORD----+
  call   <-----  | data:  none         |
 receiver        |slots:  arg1 -> val1 |
                 |        arg2 -> obj2 |
                 |             ...     |
                 |        argn -> argn |
                 +---------------------+

</pre>

<h2>primtype initialization</h2>

<p>When you define a new primitive type (that is, some C type which
should be accessible from within rhabarber, you need to export at
least the primtype variable and an <tt>*_init()</tt> function.</p>

<p>The <tt>*_init()</tt> function, typically looks like this (assuming
that you are definint <tt>foobar</tt>):
<pre class=example>
    void foobar_init(void)
    {
       if(!foobar_type) {
          // initialize the primtype
          foobar_type = primtype_new("foobar", sizeof(struct foobar_s));

          // more primtype initialization, for example virtual tables, 
          // or global variables

          // construct the first, prototypical object
          foobar_new();
    }
</pre>
First you check whether you have already been initialized, and if not,
you construct the primtype. At the end, you construct the first object
which will become the prototypical object (<tt>object_new()</tt> takes
care of that).</p>
