rhabarber
A new progamming language

The goal is to design a general purpose programming language specially
tailored to the needs of machine learning.

The special requirements of machine learning include:

    * Support for interactive, explorative programming
    * Built-in support for data types like matrices, trees, et cetera
    * Scaling prototypical implementations to large data sets 

Rhabarber tries to be as flexible as possible, and providing powerful
features in seamless manner.

===========================================

THE NOT SO EASY STEPS FOR COMPILING DELICOUS RHABABER:

0. get the source code from http://code.google.com/p/rhabarber/

1. from http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/ 
   get gc6.8.tar.gz (which is some fancy garbage collector), 
   untar it on the same level as install.txt

2. if not unix you must set some paths correctly in rha/Makefile for 
   the Python stuff, i.e. vars PY_CFLAGS, PY_LDFLAGS, PY_LOADLIBES, and
   maybe for the Matlab stuff, as well?

3. run 'make',  good luck with this, there is currently no support for you!

4. run 'cd rha'

4. run './rhabarber < test.rha | grep false'

5. if all goes well, there shouldn't be any output

6. run './rhabarber' and you can play around with it after seeing something like:

   Delicious rhabarber!
